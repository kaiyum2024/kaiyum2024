### Hello Reader,

Hello Reader! Thanks for checking out my profile. [Abdulkaiyum](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/kaiyum2012) here, a Computer Science post-graduate with great compassion for technologies and the evolving Modern era. I have several years of experience including Unity Development and software development and have performed several roles from backend and database developer, and dev-ops to AR/VR mobile developer at the senior level. I'm carrying out valuable Mobile Development skills learned at Conestoga College, ON currently. I also have enough skills for mentoring and tutoring thanks to my several years of experience in the teaching field as a passionate tutor.

Currently, Working as a Software Engineer at MCAP service corporation, Waterloo, Canada. To stay active in my passion for software development, I often work as a software engineer at - Pixel3D, concentrating on SASS-based open-source products, Mobile app development, and full-stack web applications. I am currently looking into several new technologies too.

Additionally, I am open to co-founders who share a standard set of interests and visions to fulfill their passion and hopefully make the right products. When I'm not studying or doing software development, you may find me mentoring students, watching movies, playing games, and counseling.
